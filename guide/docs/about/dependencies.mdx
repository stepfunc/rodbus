Rust's package manager (`cargo`) makes it easy to work with external dependencies. While this benefits development, Rust applications
and libraries tend to have many dependencies.

Our library directly depends on only a few third-party libraries, though those libraries have many transitive dependencies.

## Dependency Allowlisting

We use a dependency allowlist to ensure that we never incorporate unapproved dependencies. During each CI build, we perform the following
checks:

* Check every dependency against the allowlist. Our CI packaging will fail if a dependency is added with a license that has not been pre-approved.
* Produce a license report called `third-party-licenses.txt` that consolidates all the dependency and license information. We include this document in all of
our binary distributions.
* Ignore projects wholly owned by Step Function I/O, e.g. the library itself and dependencies shared with our other protocol libraries.

:::note
The license report file differs slightly for the Java library as it incorporates some additional components for the JNI functionality.

## Proprietary Compatible

All dependencies of the library have licenses that are both mutually compatible and compatible with commercial/proprietary products. We don't allow the
incorporation of strong copyleft licenses such as the GPL. You can see a complete list of allowed dependencies and licenses in <a href={`${sitedata.github_url}/blob/${sitedata.version}/dep_config.json`}>dep_config.json</a>.

## Disclaimer

We include this information because we take open source license compliance seriously. However, this information and the `third-party-licenses.txt` file are provided for reference and do not constitute legal advice. Treat this information as a starting point so you can perform your own due diligence.
