The library supports serial communication using the RTU transmission mode. RTU uses a similar Modbus addressing scheme but adds
a CRC to each transmitted frame.

Multi-drop communications may be implemented by having a single client communicating with multiple servers sharing the same serial channel. Broadcasts
messages may be used to write requests simultaneously to all server on a channel.

## Special addresses

### Broadcast

When a write request is received with the broadcast unit ID (`0x00`), it is automatically forwarded to all registered
handlers. No response will be returned.

### Reserved addresses

Addresses 248 (`0xF8`) to 255 (`0xFF`) (inclusive) are reserved in the specification and **should not be used**. The library does not
enforce this requirement, but a warning message is generated as a reminder that it may not be interoperable.

## Creating a server

To create a RTU server, first build a `DeviceMap` for each unit ID to which the server will respond. The is similar to how it's done in the [TCP server](./tcp_server).
Then use the `Server.CreateRtu` factory method to create the background task.

The `Server.CreateRtu` method takes the following arguments:

- `runtime`: tokio runtime used to drive the async process. See [Runtime](../runtime.mdx) for more details.
- `path`: path of the serial device.
  - On Windows, it's generally something like `COM3`
  - On Linux, it's generally something like `/dev/ttyS3`. You need to have the adequate permissions
    to access these devices.
- `serial_port_settings`: structure with various serial port settings:
  - Baud rate in bit per second
  - Data bits. Note that Modbus should use 8 data bits.
  - Stop bits
  - Parity
  - Flow control
- `port_retry_delay`: how long to wait before reopening after a failed open or port error.
- `map`: Map of unit ids and their corresponding callback handlers.
- `level`: Initial decoding level for the port which can be adjusted later via the returned Channel.

:::tip
The task handling the port is tolerant to the hardware device being added and removed from the system as might occur with USB to serial adapters.
