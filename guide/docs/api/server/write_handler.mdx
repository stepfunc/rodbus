The `WriteHandler` interface allows you to process write requests in your application code. Each callback receives a `Database`
object on which changes can be applied. Generally, when a value is written, it should be reflected back in
the internal database.

:::note
In Rust, the `WriteHandler` does not exist, it is merged with the `RequestHandler` trait.
:::

:::warning
The callback functions **should never block** as they are being made from a `Runtime` thread.
:::

## Return value

The return value of each callback function determines what is returned by the server. Here are the most common use cases:

- The received index and value are valid, the database is updated and a success value is returned.
- If the requested index doesn't exist, then an `ILLEGAL_DATA_ADDRESS` Modbus exception should be returned.
- If the requested value is not allowed for the point, then a `ILLEGAL_DATA_VALUE` Modbus exception should be returned.

The library automatically responds to improperly formatted requests such as ones containing invalid start/count combinations. Such invalid
requests are never forwarded to your application code.

To return an exception, the `WriteResult` value is used. It has three static methods to help build results. The `success_init`
methods is used to create a success result. The `exception_init` is used to write a standard Modbus exception. The `raw_exception_init`
is used to create a non-standard Modbus exception.
