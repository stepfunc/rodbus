The `ClientChannel` class represents a communication channel on which you can make requests to server device. `Channel` presents the same interface once you create it,
regardless of the underlying transport. You can create a TCP client channel using `create_tcp` method.

:::note
In Rust, you can use the `spawn_tcp_client_task` to create a channel and spawn the runner task in the current runtime.
Otherwise, you can use `create_tcp_handle_and_task` and manually spawn the returned future when ready.

## Maximum Queued Requests

Each channel sends one request at a time and has a fixed-length buffer of requests to send.

## Endpoint Configuration

The argument for the remote endpoint is a string in format the `<host>:<port>` where "host" must be one of the following:

* IPv4 address
* IPv6 address
* DNS name (library will perform DNS name resolution internally)

## Retry Strategy

A TCP channel tries to establish and maintain a connection as soon as it is created. To avoid flooding, reconnection delays are applied.

The `RetryStrategy` controls the rate at which the client retries failed connection attempts. The client uses exponential backoff when attempting to establish
a connection. The delay between attempts doubles from `min_delay` up to `max_delay`.

## Decode Level

See [logging configuration page](../logging.mdx#protocol-decoding) for more details.
