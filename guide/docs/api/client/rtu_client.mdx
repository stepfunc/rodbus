You can create a RTU client channel using the `create_rtu_client` method. It will immediately try to open the serial port.

:::note
In Rust, you can use the `spawn_rtu_client_task` to create a channel and spawn the async task in the context of the current runtime.
Outside the Tokio runtime, you can use `create_rtu_handle_and_task` and manually spawn the returned future.

:::info
The library does **not** support sending broadcast requests yet. Sending a request with a broadcast unit ID
(`0x00`) will generate a timeout error, because no server will respond.

## Path

A path to the serial device must be supplied. On Windows, it's generally something like `COM3`. On Linux, it's
generally something like `/dev/ttyS3`. You need to have the adequate permissions to access these devices.

## Serial Port settings

The serial port settings are the following:

- Baud rate in bit per second
- Data bits. Note that Modbus should use 8 data bits.
- Stop bits
- Parity
- Flow control

## Maximum Queued Requests

Each channel sends one request at a time and has a fixed-length buffer of requests to send.

## Retry Delay

A serial channel tries to open the serial port as soon as it is created. If the serial port cannot be opened, the library
automatically waits `retry_delay` before retrying to open the port.

## Decode Level

See [logging configuration page](../logging.mdx#protocol-decoding) for more details.
